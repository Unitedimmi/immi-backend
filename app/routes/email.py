            <p>Dear Sir / Madam,</p>
            <p>
                The visa holder has provided you with a copy of their visa details from the Department's 
                Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) service for your information.
            </p>

            <p><b>VEVO does not provide evidence of the identity of a person.</b></p>
            <p>
                Always sight the passport or the identity document, such as ImmiCard, that was used by the visa holder 
                for the VEVO visa details check; to confirm their identity and ensure that it matches the details 
                shown in the attached document.
            </p>

            <h4>Important information about VEVO</h4>
            <p>
                A VEVO check shows the visa status and conditions associated with a particular visa holder, 
                such as work or study rights.
            </p>

            <h4>Further Information for Employers</h4>
            <p>
                Employers are strongly encouraged to conduct their own VEVO visa details check, 
                as it is a criminal offence to hire or refer illegal workers in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is the responsibility of all employers to employ legal workers. 
                This includes both paid and unpaid work.
            </p>
            <p>
